## Installation

No installer has yet been created. Musicians with technical skills should read the technical documentation and set up the site.

## Usage

### Releases

Have some music ready? If you do, you have a *release*. A release is an item you want to offer as a single package. Depending on how you do things, your releases will be albums, singles, or a combination of both.

### Release Page

Releases each have their own page with all the information about it. The release page has a few common elements like cover art and a description. After that, everything can be customized with sections.

### Sections

*Sections* are the custom parts of a release page. You can put things like extra information, embedded content, and download links in sections. Each release page has its own sections, and you can order sections however you want.

All sections are based on a template. There are three templates included in One Act Records, and you can install more.

#### Free Section

The free section is for any extra content that doesn't have to follow a format. You can put some text (like a special dedication) or embed code.

#### Links Section

The links section is for a list of links, such as downloads and streaming. Note that each release can have only one links section.

Each link has a name as well as (optionally) a description and technical details.

*Common links* are links with a common name, description, and technical details, where only the URL differs. You can use them for reoccuring types of links, such as links to streaming sites. Instead of having to specify the same information over and over, you can create a *common link form* and use it when creating a link.

#### Static Section

The static section is for fixed content that is shared across multiple pages, such as copyright information.
